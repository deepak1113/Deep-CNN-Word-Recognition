# Deep-CNN-Word-Recognition

Use Matlab 2017b and higher version to run the code. 

TrainTestDivision_Preprocessing.m	contains the code for preprocessing the input images and partitioning data into train and test set. It also saves the train test data in a .mat file.

Deep_CNN_word_main.m	is the main file which contains programs for the proposed CNN model for word recognition. 

trained_network.mat contains trained CNN model 

We have trained the model on a machine with single NVIDIA Quadro K2200 4 GB GPU. The proposed model is developed using MATLAB 2017b.
