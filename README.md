# Deep-CNN-Word-Recognition

Use Matlab 2017a and higher version to run the code. 

TrainTestDivision_Preprocessing.m	

Deep_CNN_word_main.m	is the main file which contains programs for all the algrithms. To run this, write the filename in the Matlab command window.

trained_network.mat contains the preprocessed MR images of DS-255

We have trained the model on a machine with single NVIDIA Quadro K2200 4 GB GPU. The proposed model is developed using MATLAB 2017b.
